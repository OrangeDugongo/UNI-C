where is my mind? - Pixies

Ooooooh - stop

with your feet in the air
and your head on the ground
try this trick and spin it, yeah
your head will collapse
but there’s nothing in it
and you’ll ask yourself

Where is my mind
where is my mind
where is my mind

Way out in the water
see it swimmin’

I was swimmin’ in the Caribbean
animals were hiding behind the rocks
except the little fish
but they told me, he swears
tryin’ to talk to me, coy koi.

Where is my mind
where is my mind
where is my mind

Way out in the water
see it swimmin’?

With your feet in the air
and your head on the ground
try this trick and spin it, yeah
your head will collapse
if there’s nothing in it
and you’ll ask yourself

Where is my mind
where is my mind
where is my mind

Ooooh
With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
Ooooh
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Ooooh
Ooooh
